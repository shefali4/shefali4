### Hi there! 👋🏽

I'm **Shefali**, a software engineer from Seattle, Washington.

🌱  I currently work as a software engineer at **[@Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft)**. Previously, I was at **[@Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/aws)**.

I'm fascinated by high-impact, large-scale projects and have worked on industry-leading services which have millions of monthly active users. I have contributed to a handful of major feature launches at both Microsoft and AWS with high customer traffic.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of generative AI and LLMs. 🤖 I also enjoy playing tennis and baking!
